# MYAS GITHUB

hello im mya, i join random fandoms for a living and here are some things i didnt put in my intros.

- im hypersexual from non ||s/a|| related incident(s)

- im a otherlink NOT a fictionkin. otherlinks are ppl who relate very heavly to a character, its mostly for fun or as a coping mechanism. fictionkin is an alterhuman term, similar to otherkins or therians, where they belive they were that character in another life!

- i have shit internet so if im unresponsive, leave in the middle of convos / events... it cut out ðŸ’”

- im a crackshipping and selfshipper (i dont really take shipping seriously tbh.)
