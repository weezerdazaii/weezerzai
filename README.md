# MYAS GITHUB

hello im mya, i join random fandoms for a living and here are some things i didnt put in my intros.

- im hypersexual from non ||s/a|| related incident(s)

- im a kinnie NOT a kin. kinnies are ppl who relate very heavly to a character, its mostly for fun or as a coping mechanism. kinning is an alterhuman term, similar to otherkins or therians, where they belive they were that character in another life! [mb if kinnie is not the official term for it. i couldnt really find the name for it and i see most people use kinnie in that context

- i have shit internet so if im unresponsive, leave in the middle of convos / events... it cut out ðŸ’”
